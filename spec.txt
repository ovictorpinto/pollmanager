Here's the take home test. We'd like this code to be run locally. Let me know if you have any feedback, or if you or he have questions.

Desired features, in order of priority:

ok A user can come to the webpage and create a new poll.
ok The user should be able to specify a title for the poll, a brief description, and a list of options.
ok After the poll is created, the user should be able to edit the poll, and modify anything they specified originally.
ok After the poll is created, the user should be able to share their poll with their friends. This can be as simple as generating a link that they can have other people go to to respond to the poll.
ok The user should be able to view a graph of the responses to their poll.
=/ A user responding to a poll should be able to edit their response. (You do not need to authenticate users attempting to edit responses)
ok A user should be able to create an account that they can authenticate to with a username and password.
ok The only information you need is a username and password. If email addresses are usernames, you do not need to validate the email address.
ok Passwords must be securely stored. Rate-limiting of authentication requests and account lockout do not need to be implemented.
=/ A user should be able to associate all of their previously created polls with that account.
ok The user, when authenticated, should be able to view all of the polls associated with their account.
ok The user should be able to require all respondents to their polls authenticate before being able to respond to the poll.


Road map
- token/cookie for poll
- associate polls with account
